#Setup
If you want to add the bot to your server, use the link above. If you want to create your own bot with the same code, there are a few steps you must follow.
1. Go to the link: https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a new application. Then you want to add a new bot to that application. You should set the permissions to Administrator and set the application type to bot.
2. Copy your bot token in the dev portal. After you have your bot token, replace the empty string("") next to the variable token with your bot token. The variable is located in main.py
3. (Optional if you want to run the bot for free 24/7)
Copy all of the lines of code and put the code in replit. When you run the code, replit should install the dependincies. After that, a small window will pop up above the console. At the top of the window, there is a link. Copy the Link
4. Go to https://uptimerobot.com and create a free account. Next, click add monitor. In that section, select https and put the url that you copied. You can keep all of the remaining settings the same (you may want to put your email to see when the bot is down)
5. enjoy the bot!
